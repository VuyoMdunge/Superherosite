          <h4>Bio</h4> 
          <p>Hulk's full name is Bruce Banner, he was a Bioscience genius Dr. Bruce Banner focused his major studies on the effects of gamma radiation on humans, working alongside Dr. Betty Ross at a Virginia University lab. Dr. Ross’ father, General “Thunderbolt” Ross of the U.S. Army, channeled Banner’s work into a program to develop weapons for the military, unbeknownst to both doctors. When Banner decided to test what he learned on himself, he triggered a fantastic transformation in himself that resulted in an immense, hulking figure fueled by his own rage.</p>
           <p>Having destroyed his lab as the creature, and inadvertently harming Ross in the process, Banner slipped away to avoid capture and study by the Army and began a desperate quest for a cure to his bizarre affliction.He later leanrt that he had to keep his anger down to be able to revert to his smaller form.</p>
           <p>This is how Nick Fury found out about him and recruited him for the avengers.</p>
