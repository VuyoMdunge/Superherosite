          <h4>Bio</h4> 
          <p>Thor's full name is Thor Odinson.Thor was born to the King of the Asgardian Gods, Odin Borson, and the Earth Goddess Gaea. He grew up in Asgard under Odin's tutelage and trained in his footsteps to one day lead Asgard. Besides Odin, his stepmother Frigga and his adopted brother Loki are the only family he know, alongside his best friends Sif, Balder, and the Warriors Three.</p>
           <p>When Thor's battle-hungry appetite led him to break a treaty between Asgard and the Frost Giants, Odin banished him to Earth as a lesson in humility in the form of Dr. Donald Blake. As a human, he had a limp and worked as a physician. When he was compelled by Odin to go to Norway, he came upon extraterrestrials known as the Kronans and fled into a cave. There, he found a gnarled cane and used it to try and escape; he struck it against a rock, and it became Mjolnir. The mallet then restored his memories and returned him to his former glory as the mighty God of Thunder.After some time he was also found by Nick fury to form the Avengers.</p>
