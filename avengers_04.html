          <h4>Bio</h4> 
          <p>Hawkeyes full name is Clint Barton.Orphaned at an early age, Clint Barton and his brother Barney escaped an oppressive orphanage and ran away to join the circusâ€”the Carson Carnival of Traveling Wonders. The youth fell under the sway of the Swordsman, a charismatic fellow performer who teamed up with the talented Trick Shot and trained his young charge to be an expert with a bow and arrow. When Barton found his mentor embezzling funds from the show, he attempted to alert the authorities. But, instead, he suffered a beating from his roguish role model, bringing the apprenticeship to a violent end.<p/>
           <p>After awhile of being on his own he found himself in a rare encounter where he saved the life Edwin Jarvis. This got him a way into the Avengers.</p>
